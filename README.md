# Bulk User Add Plugin for WordPress

## Overview

The **Bulk User Add Plugin** for WordPress allows administrators to bulk import users from a CSV file into their WordPress site. The CSV file should contain the following data for each user:

- **Username**
- **Email**
- **Role** (optional, default is `author`)

This plugin makes it easy to add multiple users at once, saving time and reducing manual input.

## Features

- Bulk import users via CSV file.
- Support for custom user roles (if specified in the CSV file).
- Default role is set to **author** if no role is specified.
- Easy to use, user-friendly interface within the WordPress admin panel.

## How to Use

1. Once activated, navigate to **Users** > **Bulk User Add**.
2. Youâ€™ll see a file upload field where you can upload your CSV file.
3. The CSV file should contain the following columns:
   - `username`
   - `email`
   - `role` (optional)

   Example CSV:

   username,email,role user1,user1@example.com,author user2,user2@example.com,editor user3,user3@example.com


In the example above, `user3` will be assigned the default role of `author` since no role is provided.

5. The users will be added to your WordPress site, and a confirmation message will appear when the process is complete.
